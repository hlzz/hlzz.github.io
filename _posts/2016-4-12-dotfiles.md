title: Use Github as the system backup - My dotfiles  
(在Github中备份系统设置 - 我的dotfile配置)

In less than two weeks, I broke my operating system, twice. As a programmer, we all know it is a extremely painful process to re-install all the dependencies, set up configurations, etc. However, we have to face such disasters now and then. I erroneously remove "libglib*" when I tried to install gimp, the alternative of Photoshop on Linux. Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult to build from source, which is another long story. However, I am a little bit luckier this time because I started to document part of my working enviroments since my hard disk broke down two weeks ago (remember I told you that I broke my OS twice in two weeks, sad story...).

This project is still under construction, which basically contains my editor settings, frequently-used softwares and bash files. Currently it will recover my editor settings and install the latest version of cmake (3.5.1), sublime text 3(3103), meshlab, which might by helpful for Graphics/CV guys like me. 

For more instructions head over to the [dotfiles](https://github.com/hlzz/dotfiles) on GitHub.
